Implemented the tic tac toe game. Added a very simple AI and an option to enable/disable it on game end screen.
Worked on windows platform.
AI uses simple negamax algorithm with alpha/beta prunning.
At first my AI was using the visual representation of the board to perform all the calculationgs, but now I changed it to use the string representation
